# A New Year's Proposal for Ontario for Autonomous Driving

Can we start moving forward faster for practical uses of AD?

In Southern Ontario, one major low-hanging fruit is allowing some level of Autonomous Driving (AD) on the 400 series highways in the HOV lanes only.

This would be a great way to demonstrate safety, very doable, and will help reduce some traffic load.
It will also encourage more automakers to be ambitious about making advanced safety features more available.
Right now, only luxury cars have this and you still need to maintain hand control at all times.

I'm suggesting this could be loosened for cars that support it and in this dedicated, divided lane.
Cars with full adaptive

lane keeping would get a sticker and be one of the exemptions for 400-series Hov lanes.
The drivers would still be required to pay complete attention to the road at all times and be able to take over control, and absolutely no cell phone usage either.
But they could leave their hands and feet off the controls for as long as the vehicle allows.

##Caveats

One major restriction I'd add to this from personal experience and awareness

• • •

of how those systems are developed, is to say this rule would only be in force under (positive) driving conditions..
As I pointed out in [previous post link)

,
these systems are not able to deal robustly even will farely mundane Canadian winter driving conditions.
So the rule should only apply between May-September or should be based on the driving conditions being favourable in some well defined way.
