### ECML



In September I travelled to Wurzburg, Germany to present {% cite bhalla2019ecml %} which was the result of a very interesting collaboration on combustion simulation with Jean-Pierre Hickey from Mechanical Engineering. This project arose from a discussion Jean-Pierre and I had over lunch one day about possible uses of Machine Learning on mechanical engineering research, specifically in **combustion modelling**.

      <h4>Flamelet Model</h4>

      <p>
        A simplified laminar flame model is used to represent the energies released in one portion of a full flame. This *flamelet model* is used to generate a lookup table used as an approximation for combustion simulators.

In order to design better combusion engines or energy systems built on combustion, it's necessary to have a working *simulation* of the dynamics of combustion. As you can imagine, this is a complicated thing to simulate. Even though the physics is very well understood at the low level, actually calculating the energy release and fuel comsumption for a particle combustion cavity requires consideration of chemistry, physics, thermodynamics, and highly nonlinear turbulent systems. In practice, what people do is to simplify the problem down to idealized flame models call *flamelets* which are two dimensional, or *laminar*, flame-sheets resulting from firing fuel and oxidizer directly at each other. 


In this work we developed a *Fully Connected Neural Network* architecture that can be trained in a supervised manner using values computed from first principles. This network can then essentially replace the need for the lookup table. The question then is how well can this replacement work in terms of *accuracy*, *inference speed* and *interpolation* of points that were not in the training.

      <h4>Network Architecture for Composition</h4>

      <p>
        A straightforward fully connected deep neural network can be used to train a model to replace the lookup table.

- **Interpolation**: In the current popular approach used in combustion simulation, linear interpolation is often used to fill in datapoints between two known points in the table. In contrast the DNN will automatically interpolate between points using its internal model.
- **accuracy**: TODO list some results
- **speed**: We know the DNN will be slower than an explicit lookup table. We found the slow down to be a few orders of magnitude with our unoptimized code. However, the memory footprint is *vastly* smaller than the lookup table. So for larger dimensionality, such as 5 or more input variables, the current lookup table approach is not feasible as more than 4GB of memory would be needed onboard the user's machine for the table alone. The DNN, on the other hand, takes up only a few hundred MB and does not need to necessarily grow at all for higher dimensions.

### Ireland! - September

After ECML I made my way to Ireland to visit *~The Motherland~* and also was lucky enough to arrange short visits to the two big universities in Dublin. I gave a talk at **University College Dublin (UCD)** to the TODO (you can see the slides here TODO). UCD is a node in this network of AI research institutes and schools across Ireland and they really are making a name for themselves in AI in Europe. I also had a nice visit to **Trinity College** and TODO(name) who showed me around.

### Juan's papers



Juan2 {% cite carrillo2019tac %}

Juan1 {% cite carrillo2019carsp %}

Most recently my recently graduating student Juan completed a summer Mitacs internships at TODO and as a result we collected together a resulting summary of that work which was accepted for the TODO  {% cite Garijo2019 %}

To read the full paper go to the {% cite_details Garijo2019 -t details page here%}.

TODO: what about other papers I wasn't author on
- sriram had other RLDM paper
- did we have one or two AAMAS papers?
